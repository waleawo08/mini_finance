1️⃣ Create a branch named after yourself (e.g., `feature-john-doe`):  

```sh
git checkout -b feature-your-name
```
Example:  

```sh
git checkout -b feature-alex-smith
```

2️⃣ Verify that you are on the new branch:

### **Step 3: Modify the Profile Page**
1️⃣ Open the project folder in **VS Code (or any editor)**.  
2️⃣ Locate the **Profile Page file** (`profile.html`).  
3️⃣ Update the **Name, Email, and Contact Details** with your own **(avoid confidential data)**.
